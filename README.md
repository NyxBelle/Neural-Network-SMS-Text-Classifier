# 📝 Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" (normal) or "spam" (advertisement) using a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras. This notebook is part of the [freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) course.

## 📘 About the Project

In this project, we aim to predict whether a given SMS message is "ham" (normal) or "spam" (advertisement). The model was trained using the **SMS Spam Collection dataset**, and we built a neural network using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify the messages. 

### 📈 Key Features:
- **Data preprocessing**: Tokenization and vectorization of text data.
- **Neural network model**: Built with an **Embedding Layer** and **Dense layers** for SMS classification.
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: A `predict_message()` function for classifying new SMS messages.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **Google Colaboratory**
- **Pandas** / **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## 🧪 Features

- **Text preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize SMS messages.
- **Neural network architecture**: Embedding Layer + Dense layers for text classification.
- **Model evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Prediction**: A function `predict_message()` for real-time prediction of SMS messages.

## 📈 Results

The model demonstrates good accuracy in classifying SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam." It was trained using the **SMS Spam Collection dataset** and passed the evaluation with good metrics.
